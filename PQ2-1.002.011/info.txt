This is combination of the SCI Decomplie Archive version and some of the SCI-Scripts version (to fill in some assembly in the SDA code). The SDA version is used because even with fixing the errors there are bugs in SCI-Scripts decompile because you can't tab to view inventory or open the menus. Instead of fixing those issues I used the SDA code. It's got more discriptive names for things any way.
